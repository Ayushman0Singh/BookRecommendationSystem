# BookRecommendation: Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendation System

## Introduction

In the competitive online book market, robust book recommendation systems play a crucial role in attracting and retaining users. This project develops a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging user data and book ratings.

## Objective and Approach

The system aims to predict user interests and recommend relevant books. Two collaborative filtering approaches are implemented:

1. **Memory-based (k-Nearest Neighbors):** Identifies similar users based on rating history and recommends books they enjoyed.
2. **Model-based (Singular Value Decomposition):** Uncovers latent interactions between users and books to reconstruct the user-item matrix and rank recommendations.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Understand user demographics and rating distribution.
- Identify and address data cleaning requirements (null-value treatment).

### Feature Engineering:

- Apply minimum qualifying thresholds to reduce data size and address the cold start problem.
- Engineer relevant features for optimal recommendation.

### Recommendation Algorithms:

- **Memory-based:** Employ k-Nearest Neighbors to find similar users and recommend their rated books.
- **Model-based:** Use Singular Value Decomposition to model latent interactions, reconstruct the user-item matrix, and rank recommendations.

### Evaluation:

- Use Top-N accuracy metrics (Recall@N) to assess the accuracy of top recommendations compared to user interactions.

## Evaluation Results

- Recall@5: 0.14
- Recall@10: 0.22

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the successful development of a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. Further improvements could involve:

- Experimenting with different algorithms and parameters.
- Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., book attributes, content analysis).
- Dynamically adapting to user preferences and evolving trends.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced recommendation techniques (e.g., hybrid approaches).
- Enhance evaluation by considering user satisfaction and click-through rates.
- Continuously adapt and improve the system based on user feedback and evolving data.
